# Statistical-analysis

●	A Statistical Analysis is performed on the StudentData.txt dataset from the UCI machine learning repository and the data has many categorical variables like school, sex, mother’s job, father’s job etc and we found some interesting relationships between different categorical variables by summarizing the categorical variables and then relating them to the test scores.
 
 Graphical Methods used to identify key relationships
 
Math Test Score Dataset has a wide range of data in terms of the information related to the student. So, some categorical variables are taken into observation, and conclusions are drawn regarding the relationship between the given student’s information and the test scores.
Bar Plots displaying the relationship between Mother’s Job and Father’s Job and Its effect on the math test scores
Summarization of test scores based on mother’s job and father’s job
Scatter plots displaying how math test scores (G1) depend on internet connectivity
Relationships are drawn between the math test scores (G1, G2,G3) and the school they are studying in.
Scatter Plots are created depicting the relationship between the test scores (G1, G2, G3) and the reason they joined the particular school 
Datasets contain both numerical and categorical variables, so we analyzed the information considering both graphical and numeric variables across graphical summaries
